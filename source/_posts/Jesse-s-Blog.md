 My First Blog!

<!-- more -->

![BLOG](/images/BLOG.png)

Finally!

If you can read this, it means my blog started.

The server I'm using is github pages, and [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) as my domain&DNS server. GitHub student pack is very useful, it provide github pro, which allows me to have a own [domain](https://jessse.me), and free SSL certificate.

There was some problems I encountered, but I'll explain in next blog~



Your advice are most welcome, I'll do my best!



Thank you and wish you have a best day!
