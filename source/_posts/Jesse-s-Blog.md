![BLOG](/images/BLOG.png)

Finally!

If you can read this, it means my blog started.

<!-- more -->

This is my personal blog, and it used [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) as my blog framework, and [Stun theme](https://github.com/liuyib/hexo-theme-stun/blob/master/README_en-US.md).

The server I'm using is github pages, and [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) as my domain&DNS server. GitHub student pack is very useful, it provide github pro, which allows me to have a own [domain](https://jessse.me), and free SSL certificate.

There was some problems I encountered, but I'll explain in next blog~



Your advice are most welcome, I'll do my best!



Thank you and wish you have a best day!
