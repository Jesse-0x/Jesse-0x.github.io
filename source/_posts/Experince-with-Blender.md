Last month I my Art teacher assigned me sketch book homework, and also I was always want to try 3D modeling by myself. I watched this [YouTuber's](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice) video, and made the thing above.

I had a 3D printer in my home since I was in 5th grade, and I also printed lots of thing. Before, all the 3D models was downloaded from internet, and this is the first 3D object made myself (even though I just follow the video :joy:)<br><br>

### Blender

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a powerful open source tool made by python, and contains may features. Incuding

##### [Rendering](https://www.blender.org/features/rendering/)

Create jaw-dropping renders thanks to Cycles, high-end production path tracer.

##### [Modeling](https://www.blender.org/features/modeling/)

Sculpting, retopology, modeling, curves. Blender’s modeling toolset is extensive.

##### [Sculpting](https://www.blender.org/features/sculpting/)

Digital sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility required in several stages of the digital production pipeline.

##### [Animation & Rigging](https://www.blender.org/features/animation/)

Designed for animation, Blender is being used for award-winning shorts and feature films.

##### [Grease Pencil](https://www.blender.org/features/grease-pencil/)

Push the boundaries of Story Art and 2D concept design, right in Blender’s 3D viewport.

##### [VFX](https://www.blender.org/features/vfx/)

From camera and object motion tracking to masking and compositing, you can “fix it in post”.

##### [Simulation](https://www.blender.org/features/simulation/)

Featuring industry-standards libraries like Bullet and MantaFlow, Blender offers powerful simulation tools.

##### [Pipeline](https://www.blender.org/features/pipeline/)

Integration with multiple pipeline tools is pivotal in many productions.

##### [Video Editing](https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/)

The Video Editor offers a range of basic yet very efficient tools.

 <br>	<br>And one of my favorite thing about this softerware is wrote in python. It allows people to add plug-in in to the application.

For example, using a plug-in conver Mincraft map into 3D models (I don't play minecraft so if there is any problems please ignore)

--------

Eventually, there are also many different 3D modeling softerware

E.g.C4D, TinkerCAD, OnShape, SolidWorks(I saw My father using this) and more. Compare to these softerware, blender is more easy getting start to use. It is also free, open source, and provide plenty of professinal function and units. Blender also can make videos, calculate simulation, Animation and more.
