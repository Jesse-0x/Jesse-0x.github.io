Last month my Art teacher assigned me sketchbook homework, and I have always wanted to try 3D modeling by myself. I watched this [YouTuber's](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice) video, and made the thing above.

<!-- more -->

I had a 3D printer in my home since I was in 5th grade, and I also printed lots of things. Before, all the 3D models was downloaded from internet, and this is the first 3D object made myself (even though I just follow the video :joy:)<br><br>

### Blender

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a powerful open source tool made by python, and contains many features. Including

##### [Rendering](https://www.blender.org/features/rendering/)

Create jaw-dropping renders thanks to Cycles, high-end production path tracer.

##### [Modeling](https://www.blender.org/features/modeling/)

Sculpting, retopology, modeling, curves. Blender’s modeling toolset is extensive.

##### [Sculpting](https://www.blender.org/features/sculpting/)

Digital sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility required in several stages of the digital production pipeline.

##### [Animation & Rigging](https://www.blender.org/features/animation/)

Designed for animation, Blender is being used for award-winning shorts and feature films.

##### [Grease Pencil](https://www.blender.org/features/grease-pencil/)

Push the boundaries of Story Art and 2D concept design, right in Blender’s 3D viewport.

##### [VFX](https://www.blender.org/features/vfx/)

From camera and object motion tracking to masking and compositing, you can “fix it in post”.

##### [Simulation](https://www.blender.org/features/simulation/)

Featuring industry-standards libraries like Bullet and MantaFlow, Blender offers powerful simulation tools.

##### [Pipeline](https://www.blender.org/features/pipeline/)

Integration with multiple pipeline tools is pivotal in many productions.

##### [Video Editing](https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/)

The Video Editor offers a range of basic yet very efficient tools.

##### [Scripting](https://www.blender.org/features/scripting/)

Featuring an extensive Python API, every tool is available for scripting and customization

##### [Interface](https://www.blender.org/features/interface/)

Because of its custom architecture, Blender’s UI, window layout and shortcuts can be fully customized.

 <br>	<br>And one of my favorite things about this software is written in python. It allows people to add plug-in into the application.

For example, using a plug-in convert Minecraft map into 3D models (I don't play minecraft so if there is any problems please ignore)

--------

Eventually, there are also many different 3D modeling software

E.g.C4D, TinkerCAD, OnShape, SolidWorks(I saw My father using this) and more. Compared to these software, blender is easier to start using. It is also free, open source, and provides plenty of professional functions and units. Blender also can make videos, calculate simulation, Animation and more.
